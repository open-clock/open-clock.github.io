                <p>
                    The idea for Open Clock came when project leader Benedikt Werner noticed that many students looked at their phones during class to check the schedule, which often led to distractions. The solution: A classroom clock that not only shows the time but also displays the schedule.

                  <p>
                    After research, the team found that there are no comparable products. Digital signage displays are power-intensive and not specifically tailored to the needs of schools.

                <p>
                    The goal of Open Clock is to develop an innovative classroom clock that not only shows the current time but also displays important school information such as the schedule or current tasks. The clock is intended to help minimize distractions from smartphones and make lessons more efficient.

                <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">Energy Efficiency</h3>
                <p>
                    By using e-ink displays, power consumption is greatly reduced as energy is only needed when updating the display.

                <p>
                    Open Clock is modular and can be used in both classrooms and private households. The school version includes a large display for wall or ceiling mounting, while the home version is more compact and suitable for the desk.
